# Git Attributes Configuration for VERIDEX
# ==========================================
# This file configures how Git and GitHub handle various file types in this repository.

# Language Statistics Configuration
# ----------------------------------
# The data/ directory contains ~23,000 email samples (ham/spam) used for testing
# the spam classifier. These are legitimate test datasets from SpamAssassin corpus.
#
# Without this configuration, GitHub's linguist incorrectly identifies these
# extensionless email files as "roff" format due to their structured headers,
# which skews language statistics away from the actual Python codebase.
#
# Marking these as 'linguist-vendored' excludes them from language stats while
# keeping them accessible in the repository. This is standard practice for
# ML/data science projects with large datasets.

data/** linguist-vendored

# Result files should also be excluded from language detection
results/** linguist-vendored

# Documentation
# -------------
# Ensure markdown files are properly detected
*.md linguist-documentation

# Source Code
# -----------
# Python files are correctly detected by default, no configuration needed
# *.py linguist-language=Python
